        <h2>Go beyond compliance</h2>
        <p class="lead">Work with staff that want to be safe</p>
        <p>Improving safety performance by enforcing inane rules and regulations doesn't guarantee compliance. By introducing a new philosophy on culture, the Journey Program empowers employees to participate in relevant training and comply with regulations they understand.</p>
        <p>Our methodology results in much higher buy-in from the workforce and leads to collective improvement of safety performance.</p>

        <h2>Connect operators and leadership</h2>
        <p class="lead">Bridge the gap in culture and language</p>
        <p>The different tiers of an organisation are often separated by the use of different language. The Journey Program uses a common language to make operational procedures relevant to every part of an organisation's hierarchy; from apprentice all the way up to CEO.</p>
        <p>Our research shows that company leadership fails to improve safety when procedures are imposed on operators without communication. We help you communicate procedures in a language everybody understands. Then we monitor your performance to help you improve KPIs.</p>

        <p>Our content is designed to be digestible and practical. We take content that previously might have taken three to four weeks to deliver and condense it to less than a week. By doing so we make a complex issue accessible, easy to understand, and easy to implement.</p>

        <h2>Makes injury prevention easy</h2>
        <p class="lead">A function of better procedure, communication and culture</p>
        <p>The best way to engage with safety is to not talk about safety. By improving other aspects of a business, for example the way procedures are managed, followed and communicated, the resulting culture is by default one that delivers safety.</p>
