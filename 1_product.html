        <h1>Set targets. Hit them. Repeat.</h1>
        <p class="lead">The Journey Program assesses your current tolerance for risk and shows you opportunities to improve. We help you set targets relative to your situation and give you sustainable, practical processes to meet and exceed those targets.</p>

        <h2>Go beyond compliance</h2>
        <p class="lead">Work with staff that want to be safe</p>
        <p>Improving safety performance by enforcing inane rules and regulations doesn't guarantee compliance. By introducing a new philosophy on culture, the Journey Program empowers employees to participate in relevant training and comply with regulations they understand.</p>
        <p>Our methodology results in much higher buy-in from the workforce and leads to collective improvement of safety performance.</p>

        <h2>Connect operators and leadership</h2>
        <p class="lead">Bridge the gap in culture and language</p>
        <p>The different tiers of an organisation are often separated by the use of different language. The Journey Program uses a common language to make operational procedures relevant to every part of an organisation's hierarchy; from apprentice all the way up to CEO.</p>
        <p>Our research shows that company leadership fails to improve safety when procedures are imposed on operators without communication. We help you communicate procedures in a language everybody understands. Then we monitor your performance to help you improve KPIs.</p>

        <h2>Concise and accessible training</h2>
        <p class="lead">Less time learning = more time operating</p>
        <p>Our content is designed to be digestible and practical. We take content that previously might have taken three to four weeks to deliver and condense it to less than a week. By doing so we make a complex issue accessible, easy to understand, and easy to implement.</p>
        <p>Instead of complex formulas, management jargon or ‘safety speak’, the Program uses intuitive phrases to assist people to manage risk whether they are the most Senior Manager or a team member</p>

        <h2>Makes injury prevention easy</h2>
        <p class="lead">A function of better procedure, communication and culture</p>
        <p>At the core of the Journey Program is a simple communication model used to illustrate the process of changing from the present state to the future state. This innovative and easily understood model becomes a mechanism to focus leadership and risk reduction efforts across the business. </p>
        <p>We've found that the best way to engage with safety is to not talk about safety. By improving other aspects of a business, for example the way procedures are managed, followed and communicated, the resulting culture is by default one that delivers safety.</p>

        <p><strong>The Journey Books</strong></p>
        <p>The Journey books give an organisation the terminology to simplify how they think about, communicate and manage injury risk. A series of books have been tailored to meet the specific needs of three groups of safety leaders – Supervisors, Team Members and Safety Advisors.</p>
        <p>The Supervisor book is a manual and resource for anyone with a team to manage. The Team Member book is designed for Supervisors to deliver with or without support from the Journey Coach to their teams. This version has a lower reading age and more pictures to accommodate a wider audience.</p>

        <p><strong>Workshops and Coaching</strong></p>
        <p>During the workshop sessions the focus is on providing real skills, talking about how to apply the skills in the workplace and using the experience of the coach and the group to illustrate their use.</p>
        <p>Coaching is a vital part of the Journey ProgramTM and is done in field. It gives participant the one on one practical support they require and focuses on imbedding the new behaviours learnt during the training into every day practice and building the safety culture. Your coach will have years of experience in their discipline and a thorough knowledge of the journey program.</p>

        <p><strong>MyJourney Performance Management</strong></p>
        <p>MyJourney is a Performance Management System which aims to set clear performance expectations (tailored to your business) to all persons in the business - so you, your team and your organisation can show how they are contributing to sustain or reduce the level of injury risk on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>A MyJourney plan is set up for individuals outlining the tasks to be completed; personal KPIs can also be added. The system produces a risk snapshot giving the user immediate feedback on how they are tracking.</p>
