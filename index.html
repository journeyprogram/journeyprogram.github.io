        <h2>Focused on performance, not just safety</h2>
        <hr />

        <p>The Journey Program is a novel approach to organisational safety management. The program is based on an organisation-wide philosophy of improving culture and leads to improved safety performance as a function of company success.</p>

        <p>Changing your company's culture results in a positive feedback loop. As your safety record improves, so does your overall performance; essentially we help every person in the company perform their job better. This iterates infinitely: The result is safe, efficient and effective workplaces.</p>

Marcus and [The Journey Program] have been a critical part in the successful development of the safety system, also assisting in the implementation here and overseas."
