  <p>This is a case study. You can read all about it.</p>

  <p>Professor Patrick Hudson’s talks (YouTube links) provide excellent guidance on the prevention of injuries through leadership, culture and organisational change. He summarises the components which contribute to an effective organisational culture: Leadership; Respect; Informed; Mindful; Just and Fair; Learning. As these components are embedded, an organisation will gradually move up the cultural maturity ‘ladder’. The first step takes the organisation from a ‘pathological’ culture to a ‘reactive’ one, then upwards to ‘calculative’, ‘proactive’, and finally the highest level, a ‘generative’ culture.</p>
