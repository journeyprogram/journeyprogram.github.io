WEST Coast has sent Fremantle's season into free-fall after the Eagles claimed a hard-fought 33-point victory in Western Derby 43 at Domain Stadium on Saturday night.

The Eagles held off a brave and undermanned Dockers side to win 12.20 (92) to 8.11 (59) in wet conditions in Perth.

It is the Dockers' worst start to a season under Ross Lyon and the first time they have lost the first three games of a season since 2009.

The insult of a third straight loss was compounded by a significant injury to Aaron Sandilands.

The Dockers' reigning best and fairest was sent to hospital at half-time with a collapsed lung after copping a knee in the ribcage from Nic Naitanui in a marking contest.
