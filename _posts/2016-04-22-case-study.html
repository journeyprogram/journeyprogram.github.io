  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>An open cut mine site of around 400 people had a very poor safety performance, which the General Manager Mining said was keeping him awake at night.  Over one month Surface Mining Equipment was involved in three high potential incidents (i.e. potential fatality) and other serious incidents occurred regularly.  The severity rate of injuries was extreme, including several long term (i.e. over 100 days) lower back pain injuries, “mental stress” cases and so on. </p>
  <h2>Identification</h2>
  <p>On arrival at the site the Mine Manager who was due to introduce Dr Cattani and a Journey Program coach informed that there had been a serious incident.  A piece of Surface Mining Equipment had slipped over the edge of a dump and the driver was being rescued.  Anyone with relevant emergency management or investigation experience was required to assist.  Over the next two days an operational and cultural gap analysis of the mine site was conducted as part of the incident investigation.</p>
  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The site was being run informally by an ‘old school’ Mine Superintendent, who was quite clearly a bully.  He worked 18 hours or more a day, routinely shouted and swore directions at people whether they were doing the right thing or not.  He was universally hated by everyone.  During pre-shift and any meeting he attended he created anxiety and tension.  His approach was “leave him alone, this is his site”.  Interaction indicated he did not understand the impact of his actions on his people, and he had never been trained to lead a team.   In response to his style, the organisational culture of the site was “pathological” (i.e. a blame culture, devoid of leadership).  A whole series of issues had arisen, which needed to be unravelled.  The whole site, including its safety management systems had evolved into compliance based approach, totally ineffective at managing injury risk.  The safety team did not see why their system did not work. </p>
  <h2>Risk Treatment</h2>
  <p>The Journey Program for Supervisors was used as a framework for front line leadership training and coaching, for the whole leadership team.  Groups of 4 people, in peer groups attended 1.5 hour informal workshop led by the Journey Program coach.  Following the workshop, each participant was visited in the field by the coach, to help them one on one with their new skills.  The 50 person leadership team progressed through the 8 steps of the Journey Program together, over 2 months.</p>
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>Results were obvious immediately.  People started communicating effectively; they started working together for a common goal, they understood the importance of their role in the team.  Team members commented that they did not know what had happened to their Supervisor, but it was amazing.  The Mining Superintendent who had not had any leadership training before was awakened to his impact on his people.  He changed how he operated, and immediately the tension on the site disappeared.  He started to delegate rather than do everything, so he wasn’t so tired and angry, he communicated and managed.  He and the Mine Manager worked together on a site management plan, using the Journey Program planning templates, and they monitored their progress towards their targets.  The Mining Superintendent saw the positive impact of the Journey Program and become a champion of its use.</p>
  <p>The Journey Program coach left the site with tools to sustain the performance improvement.  After 9 months the Mine Manager was asked to assist other sites in the business to show them how he had turned the site around.</p>
